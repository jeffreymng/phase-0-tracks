# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows a user to see when a file is changed, who changed it, and why they changed it. It is useful because you can see all of the above and it gives a chronology of what was done to particular files.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an alternate of a master directory in which users can create and edit files without changing the original file in the master directory. It is good to use branches when working collaboratively as any changes made by other users are not immediately saved to the master directory and can be added without conflict.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit saves the work you have done on a file along with a message detailing what you have done to it. A good commit message details what you changed or added to a file.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two branches are being merged, but a file, or code in a file, in either branch does not correspond to the other.
