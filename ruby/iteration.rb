# A method that iterates through the items, deleting any that meet a certain condition (for example, deleting any numbers that are less than 5).
# A method that filters a data structure for only items that do satisfy a certain condition (for example, keeping any numbers that are less than 5).
# A different method that filters a data structure for only items satisfying a certain condition -- Ruby offers several options!
