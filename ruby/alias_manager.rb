# define a method that swaps the first and last name, changes all vowels to next vowel, and changes all consonants to next consonant
# define variables for vowels and consonants for .index use
# define a method that takes one argument (a string)
# change all letters in string to lowercase
# separate first and last name using .split(' ') and reorder them
# separate each letter in the string into an array using .split or .chars
# use .each to compare each letter in the array to vowels and consonants
# advance vowels one letter forward and advance consonants one letter forward
# create conditional statements for letters 'u' and 'z' to advance to 'a' and 'b', respectively, to deal with edge case
# put the letters back together to form a name
# capitalize the new name
