# Plan to study jQuery
* Google/Wikipedia jQuery. What can I do with it and what is it used for?
* Learn about objects in jQuery and what I can do with them
* Learn syntax of jQuery. Look up the documentation
* Figure out how to print to the console for debugging purposes
* Learn about functions in jQuery. Look up common built in functions and test them.
* Go to CodeAcademy and take courses. Skip the courses that I've learned already through research to stay within 2 hour limit
