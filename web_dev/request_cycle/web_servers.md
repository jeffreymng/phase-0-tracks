# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
The main design philosophy of Linux is about modularity. Programmers should be able to create small, separate programs that are able to easily connect with each other. Each program does one thing very well and is able to interact with other programs efficiently. Programs are also all written in plain text rather than binary so that programs can be easily portable from a linux system to other systems.

# In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS is a virtual machine run by a company that leases out RAM and processing power for a customer to use for their own purposes, such as hosting a website. The advantage of using a VPS are that there is little risk in using one as opposed to a user using their own machine and potentially breaking it. In the case of a VPS, if the user breaks anything in a program or the machine, the VPS can easily be remade. It also offers some security as people who visit the website won't be able to access the programmer's own physical machine.

# Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
A root user can do anything on the Linux system and any programs run by a root user could potentially damage important system files.
