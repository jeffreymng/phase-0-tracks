<!-- The purpose of html semantic tags is to show the flow of information and to separate the information into different, meaningful, sections. I think the most useful semantic tags are <main> and <section>. Sublime is also incredibly useful, especially when I learned how to create snippets. I've already created one and I will definitely add more in the future. One of the concepts that kind of confused me a bit was the use of the <article> tag. I am definitely going to do more research and find more examples for the use of the article tag so that I can start using it on my own. -->
