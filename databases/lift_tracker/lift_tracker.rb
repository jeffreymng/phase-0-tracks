# Create a program to keep track of what lifts you performed on what dates.
# Store all info in a database
# Ask user for input
  # Date
  # What part of the body was worked on (upper body, back, legs) store in database as foreign key. Create separate database for this.
  # What exercises were performed
  # Assuming 3 sets performed for each exercise
  # Number of reps
  # Weight lifted for each set
# Create methods to call information from database
